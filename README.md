# titanic
This is my first machine learning project. This project is from Kaggle practice competition Titanic: Machine Learning from Natural Disaster.

It is done in Jupyter Notebook with Python. I used KFold and RandomForestClassifier for my machine learning portion and score 0.75666 on Kaggle. I learned parts of the code from tutorial on Kaggle and online to debug and solve my problems.
